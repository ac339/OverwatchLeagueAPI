# OverwatchLeagueAPI
A C# wrapper for the Overwatch League API.

**NOTICE:**
On July 20, 2018, the Overwatch League commissioner, Nate Nanzer, [made a post on Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/8z8ysf/the_dream_comes_true_match_stats_are_finally_here/e2p4tcl/) stating that the official API isn't quite ready for public consumption at this time. As such, work on this wrapper will recommence once Blizzard are ready to officially release their API to the public! ðŸ˜€

## Requirements
- .NET Standard 2.0
- Newtonsoft's [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) library - v. 11.0.2

## Installation instructions
- Clone or download it from Github as a .zip file.
- Build the library and add it to your application as a dependency.
- Additionally, also ensure that you add Newtonsoft.Json to your application as a dependency:
  - Go to "Project" > "Manage NuGet Packages"
  - Find "Newtonsoft.Json", click on it, and click "Install". Ensure that the version being installed is 11.0.2.

## Usage
Currently, the endpoint for retrieving the match details of a particular map is functional:
```c#
OverwatchLeagueApi api = new OverwatchLeagueApi();
Map map = await api.GetMapStats("10528", "1");
```
For further details, see the OverwatchLeagueAPI.Example project.

For all found endpoints, please see: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/8z8ysf/the_dream_comes_true_match_stats_are_finally_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/8z8ysf/the_dream_comes_true_match_stats_are_finally_here/)
